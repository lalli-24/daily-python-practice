# Day 13 - Searching Algorithms

This folder contains Python implementations of **searching techniques**.

## Files:
1. `linear_search_basic.py` → Check if element exists.
2. `linear_search_count.py` → Count occurrences of element.
3. `linear_search_indices.py` → Return all indices of element.
4. `matrix_search.py` → Search for element in a 2D matrix.
5. `binary_search_iterative.py` → Iterative Binary Search (sorted arrays only).
6. `binary_search_recursive.py` → Recursive Binary Search (sorted arrays only).

---
Practice Goal: Understanding both **Linear Search** and **Binary Search** deeply before moving to Sorting algorithms.
